# An Simple Introduction
The name of the account is Boaty...And now an undergraduate in Wuhan University, China.
Started programming at a young age but basically no progress as time flies...
Actually I would like to **be honest to admit** that I still cannot find the real passion and spirit of coding, at least **as for me**.
**Being honest and modest, maybe diligent sometimes...** That is what I aim to right now.
